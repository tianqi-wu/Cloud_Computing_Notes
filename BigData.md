## What is Big Data?

Big Data is collecting massive amounts of data; every day we produce and collect a large amount of data.  
One important aspect derived from big data is data products, which are highly personalized; data applications get their values from data.

### Three Vs of big data:

**Volume**(The large amount of data present)

**Variety**(The types of data are astronomical(graphs, music, etc))

**Velocity**(The speed of data generation)

### Definitions regarding data:

**Data**: A collection of records also called datapoints

**Datapoint**: A collection of attributes, also called **features**.

**Features**: Are usually represented by sets, arrays and lists.

**Label**: A special feature only observed for some data points, closely to observe

**Structured/Unstructed**: Data is in free form(Usually are expressed in tables or fixed lengths)/No fixed patterns

**Semi-Structured**: Know how to extract the features into a table/array

Examples: Text: (Unstructured) Articles, Blog Posts; (Semi-Structured) Ususally has fixed patterns

### Characteristics of big data

Amount(millions of points), Size(how large the files are), Inifinity(streams of data), Structured, Complexity

### Big Data

Workflow: Data -> Datalake -> warehouse visual -> Exploration | Computation | Transformation | Insights

**Query(function of all data)**: Immutable, work on DATA

Example: Risk Assessment, Machine Translation, Social-Network Analysis
